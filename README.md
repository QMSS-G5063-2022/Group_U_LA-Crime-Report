## Project Title
Spatial and Temporal Trends Analysis of Criminal Activity in LA


## Project Objective

* In recent years, the importance of spatiotemporal integration has been increasingly recognized. However, methods for analyzing patterns of association with place and time in crime research remain to be further developed.

* Crime has become one of the most striking problems in the United States. This project aims to help us better visualize and understand spatial and temporal trends in criminal activity.


## Data
* Crime Data from 2020 to Present
* Data can be accessed from: https://data.lacity.org/Public-Safety/Crime-Data-from-2020-to-Present/2nrs-mtv8


## Key Components
* Data processing: selected crimes that completed investigation in Los Angeles from 2020 to the present and deleted the types of cases that happened less than 500 times.
* World map: Visualize the number of crimes from 2020 to present, and display crime incident locations on the map using leaflet.
* Aggregate data & temporal trends: The overall percentage of each types of crime. And specifically, how robbery and burglary change over time.
* Correlation Analysis：Explore the correlation between crime rate for each week day versus crime category, distrct, month, and year.
